* Implement next permutation, which rearranges numbers into the lexicographically next greater permutation of numbers.

If such arrangement is not possible, it must rearrange it as the lowest possible order (ie, sorted in ascending order).

The replacement must be in-place and use only constant extra memory.

Here are some examples. Inputs are in the left-hand column and its corresponding outputs are in the right-hand column.

1,2,3 â†’ 1,3,2
3,2,1 â†’ 1,2,3
1,1,5 â†’ 1,5,1

/*

* To solve this problem there are 3 steps -
* 1 start from right of the given number and find the first decreasing digit from its left, note the index value (let us say it is -i)
* 2.Find the next higher digit on the right side of i, let us say it is at j
* 3.Swap the digits at i and j
* 4.now starting from next digit to the right of i, reverse the digits.
