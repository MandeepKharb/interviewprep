/*
*Given a square grid of size N, each cell of which contains integer cost which represents a cost to traverse through that cell, we need to find a path from top left cell to bottom right cell by which total cost incurred is minimum.

Note : It is assumed that negative cost cycles do not exist in input matrix.

Input:
The first line of input will contain number of testcases T. Then T test cases follow. Each test case contains 2 lines. The first line of each test case contains an integer N denoting the size of the grid. Next line of each test contains a single line containing N*N space separated integers depicting the cost of respective cell from (0,0) to (N,N).

Output:
For each test case output a single integer depecting the minimum cost to reach the destination.

Constraints:
1 <= T <= 50
1 <= N <= 50

Example:
Input:
